    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
      <p>CSS Selectors are used to select/find the HTML elements we want to style. Some of the popular/basic selectors we use are:
        
        <ul>
          <li><span id="lists">Element Selector: </span>These selects HTML elements based on the name.  </li> <br >
            <img src="img/h1_element.png" alt="H1 Element">
          
          <li><span id="lists">Id Selector: </span>This is used to select the id attribute of an HTML Element to select a specific Element. Becasue of it's uniqueness, it can only be used where specified. The did element can override all other element when used.
          </li> <br >
            <img src="img/id_element.png" alt="ID Selector">
          
          <li><span id="lists">CSS Class Selector: </span>This is used to select HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To be able to select elements with a specific class, we use a period(.) character followed by the class name.</li>
            <br >
            <img src="img/class_element.png" alt="Class Selector">

          <li><span id="lists">CSS Grouping Selector: </span>This selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style formats. Grouping the selectors with the same style format helps minimize the codes and it is seperated with a comma(,).</li>
           <br >

        </ul>
